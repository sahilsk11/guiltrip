The idea was simple: show people how much they don't need stuff.

Humans love spending money - and why shouldn't we? Most of our lives are spent trying to make cash, and it is only reasonable that we blow it when we feel like it.

There's nothing wrong with that, except we often spend on things we don't truly need or even want. We sometimes spend because of boredom or to make a statement.

In today's world however, money has the power to do incredible good. And our goal is to help people realize this.

We love help! It would be awesome to add more content to the website.

Add elements to data.json with the format:
```
var data = {
    "childrenFed": {
        "value": 0, //don't worry about this, it is calculating
        "src": "images/feed.jpg", //image source
        "type": "donation", //add a label
        "string": "feed VAR WORD in war-stricken environments for one day", //VAR is the number, word is the noun
        "singularWord": "child", //singular form on noun
        "pluralWord": "children", //plural form
        "sourceName": "World Food Programme", //Source of data
        "sourceUrl": "https://sharethemeal.org/en/index.html", //Source/Donation url
        "threshold": 1, //the minimum accepted value to diplay. 0.01 would be 1%
        "cost": 0.5, //cost of a singular item
        "donate": true //display the donation link
    }
 ```
