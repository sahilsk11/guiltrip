# guilt.rip

The idea was simple: show people how much they don't need stuff.

Humans love spending money - and why shouldn't we? Most of our lives are spent trying to make cash, and it is only reasonable that we blow it when we feel like it.

There's nothing wrong with that, except we often spend on things we don't truly need or even want. We sometimes spend because of boredom or to make a statement.

In today's world however, money has the power to do incredible good. And our goal is to help people realize this.
